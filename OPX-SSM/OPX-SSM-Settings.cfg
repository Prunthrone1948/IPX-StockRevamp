// EXPLANATIONS
// KerbolCharacteristics – Affords three options of what Kerbol looks like:
//     MainSeq – rescales it into a realistic G-class member of the main sequence with appropriate color and textures
//     Subgiant – leaves it in its current size, but gives it the appropriate color and texture of a subgiant star of that size in an attempt to be realistic
//     Stock – changes nothing whatsoever. Set to this if you have BetterKerbol or another sun-modifying mod installed. 
//     All three of these add the Kerbol displayname and biome map.
// If false, leaves Kerbol its current size, modifying its color into that of a realistic subgiant. 
// MunRelocation - relocates the Mun into a more distant orbit for both realism and to keep solar eclipses for the kerbol realism patch
// If this is true, MinmusRelocation is automatically read as true because their orbits would be 25 kilometers apart
// MinmusRelocation - relocates Minmus from its stock position or not
// MinmusPosition - if MinmusRelocation or MunRelocation are true, where Minmus will be placed.
// Options:
// 	Hilda - places Minmus in the distant asteroid belt in a 3:2 resonance with Jool
// 	Trojan - places Minmus within Kerbin's leading lagrange point
// MinmusResize – makes Minmus 2/3 its original size because 60 km is actually really big
