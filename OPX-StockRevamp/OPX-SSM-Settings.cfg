// EXPLANATIONS
// KerbolCharacteristics – Affords three options of what Kerbol looks like:
//     MainSeq – rescales it into a realistic G-class member of the main sequence with appropriate color and textures
//     Subgiant – leaves it in its current size, but gives it the appropriate color and texture of a subgiant star of that size in an attempt to be realistic
//     Stock – changes nothing whatsoever. Set to this if you have BetterKerbol or another sun-modifying mod installed. 
//     All three of these add the Kerbol displayname and biome map.
// MunRelocation - relocates the Mun into a more distant orbit for both realism and to keep solar eclipses for the kerbol realism patch
// If MinmusPosition is set to Stock, MunRelocation is prevented from taking effect, as their orbits would be 25 km apart. 
// MinmusPosition - where Minmus is placed.
// Options:
// 		Hilda - places Minmus in the distant asteroid belt in a 3:2 resonance with Jool
// 		Trojan - places Minmus within Kerbin's leading lagrange point
//		Stock – places Minmus in its stock position. This option forces MunRelocation to False. 
// MinmusResize – makes Minmus 2/3 its original size because 60 km is actually really big
// Atmosphere settings:
// DunaAtmoChallenge – Thins out Duna's atmosphere considerably to 0.015 atm of surface pressure at 21 km of height, bringing it closer to real life Mars' atmosphere without completely making it unplayable. 
// UNIMPLEMENTED: EveAtmoChallenge – Thickens the atmosphere considerably to <undetermined> atm of surface pressure, bringing it closer to IRL Venus without making it completely unplayable
// MohoAtmoChallenge – Adds an extremely rareified atmosphere to Moho, solely there to be hot and annoying and break parachutes. You can't go as close to the surface in orbit and you have to bring more heat shielding to land. Have fun!
